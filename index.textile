h2. Getting Started

Check out the "installation guide":README.html for all the details but you'll basically be doing this:

# Download and install python for your platform
# Download MyMedia
# Put your Roku into developer mode
# Run springboard to install the channel on your Roku and start the server

h2. For the Daring

The features that eventually make it into the main distribution start their lives in the "developer's preview":developers_preview.html version. If you're willing to encounter and "report":http://forums.roku.com/viewtopic.php?&t=25955 a few bugs please give it a try! We need your help to iron out the wrinkles for everyone else.
