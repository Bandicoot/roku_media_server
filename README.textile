h2. Getting Started

MyMedia is actually two pieces of software

* Roku channel designed for the Roku set-top box 
* Server software that runs on your computer to send data to your Roku

h2. Disclaimer

Following these instructions could break your computer or your Roku. I don't think anything bad will happen and I've been careful but it's a very real possibility that something could break. Don't hold me responsible if they do. If this breaks something for you, I'm sorry, and if you ask nice I may try to help you. No promises, no warranty.

h2. Security Warning

The way the server works essentially exposes all of the mp3's in your music folder to an outside user with intimate knowledge of this program.  Definitely don't run this unless your local network is somehow isolated from the internet at large -- ie, you're behind a router.  

In other words: If your IP address isn't something like 192. ? . ? . ? or 10 . ? . ? . ? -- for the love of your data, PLEASE don't run the server.

h2. Installation

# "Add the private channel to your Roku":https://owner.roku.com/Account/ChannelCode/?code=mymedia

# Start the channel and then visit "the MyMedia registration page":http://rokumm.appspot.com/ to enter the registration code you were given.

# Continue by downloading, installing, starting, and configuring the MyMedia server as detailed by the "installation guide":http://rokumm.appspot.com/walkthro

h2. Python

The software that runs on your computer is written in a language called python and must be run by another program called an interpreter. There is a version of _the python interpreter_ for most operating systems.
