h2. License

The server code in this package is to be distributed under the terms of the GPL. The client code is also GPL but with a special exception for the Roku business entity (per their SDK license agreement.)

Some third party code is also included in the web, simplejson, and eyeD3 folders. Each of these are distributed under their author's original license (look in their source to see what they are.)

h2. Security Warning

The way the server works essentially exposes all of the mp3's on your computer to an outside user with intimate knowledge of this program.  Definitely don't run this unless your local network is somehow isolated from the internet at large -- ie, you're behind a router.  

In other words: If your IP address isn't something like 192.*.*.* or 10.*.*.* -- for the love of your data, PLEASE don't run the server.  

h2. Disclaimer

I don't think it will happen but following these instructions could break your computer or your Roku. Don't hold me responsible if they do. If this breaks something for you, I'm sorry, and if you ask nice I may try to help you. No promises, no warranty, good luck.

h1. INSTALLATION

# Download and install python for your platform

# Put your Roku into developer mode

# Run springboard.py to install the channel on your Roku and start the server

h2. Details

h3. Download and install python for your platform

h4. Linux Users

You probably already have it. Type python and if it starts up press Ctrl+D to quit and skip this section.

Ubuntu users:

pre. sudo aptitude install python

h4. Windows Users

Go to "http://www.python.org/download":http://www.python.org/download and select the Windows installer that suits your platform (32 or 64 bit.) Run it, accept all the defaults,

h3. Put your Roku into developer mode

Here's some more legal hairy-ness. Based on the SDK agreement with Roku, I'm not sure what I'm allowed to tell you here... so you'll have to discover it for yourself.

Search the web for "roku SDK" and hit the first link (the roku developers site.) Agree to everything, download the sdk, and in the documentation directory you'll find a document called the developers guide which starts out with instructions for putting your player into development mode. Do that stuff. Write down the IP address of your player.

h3. Run springboard.py to install...

Run the automated client/server installation tool.

h4. Linux

pre. cd server
python springboard.py

h4. Windows

Double click on springboard.vbs or springboard_debug.bat.

Or, if that doesn't work (because you put python somewhere weird):

Start | Programs | Python | IDLE

Menu: File | Open

Navigate to where you put roku_media_player

Open springboard.py

Menu: Run | Run Module (or press F5)

h4. All Users

Set all configuration variables in the tool. Click on "Install Client" to update your Roku (at the IP address you specified) and click on "Start Server" to start the server. Note that sometimes the Roku will automatically launch the client after you upload it. If this happens you'll need to go back to the home screen and then launch it again after you've started the server.

You're done!

h1. Usage

Fire up the client. You should find it on your home channel listing. It's called "Music Player" and has the subtitle "Play music from your local network." It should very quickly give you a listing of the mp3's and the subdirectories in the music directory you configured. Navigate, hit enter, and you're off.

If it doesn't, you may have forgotten to set the host name in either the client code or the server code. Do the server test above. If that works, try it again from another computer (if you can.) If that doesn't work then you probably have a firewall problem. If you can get to your server from another computer then you probably didn't set the host correctly when you edited the source code to the client. Go back and try again.  

Still having problems? Email me and I may be able to help.

Good luck!!

h1. Epilogue

This is a work in progress. I welcome feedback from your experiences. Let's make this readme file much better.
