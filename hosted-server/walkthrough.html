	  #1: Download and install python for your platform
	</a>

	<div class="content">
	  The software that runs on your computer is written in a
	  language called python and must be run by another program
	  called an interpreter. There is a version of the python
	  interpreter for most operating systems. This software is
	  designed to work with the 2.6 series of the python
	  interpreter (though other versions may work as well.) You
	  will also need a python library called PIL that is used by
	  the MyMedia server to re-size your photos before sending them
	  to your box.
	</div>

	<div class="content">
	  <b>Linux Users:</b> You probably already have python
	  installed. It's pretty standard. Type python and if it
	  starts up press Ctrl+D to quit. You probably will need to
	  install PIL. Debian and Ubuntu users can do this by typing:
	  <pre>sudo aptitude install python-imaging</pre>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
	  <b>Windows Users:</b> Go to
	  <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/">
	    the python 2.6 release page</a> and download and run the
	  32 bit Windows installer. Accept all of the defaults. You'll
	  want to pick the 32 bit installer even if you're running 64
	  bit windows because there isn't an official version of PIL
	  for 64 bit windows. After python is installed,
	  <a href="http://effbot.org/downloads/PIL-1.1.7.win32-py2.6.exe">
	    download and install PIL.</a>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
	  <b>Mac Users:</b> You already have the right version of
	  python but you still need to install PIL.
	  <a href="http://ethan.tira-thompson.org/Mac_OS_X_Ports.html">
	    Download and install the base image conversion
	    libraries</a>. Select the combo installer. Next install
	    PIL by opening the Terminal and typing:

	  <pre>sudo easy_install --find-links http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ Imaging</pre>

	  Use the same password that you normally use for OS X
	  software installs. It may look like nothing is happening for
	  a couple of seconds so be patient. When the installation
	  completes you should see text on the terminal saying that
	  jpeg support is available. You can now close the terminal
	  window.
