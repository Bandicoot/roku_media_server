This media player is derived from the simplevideoplayer example
that comes with the Roku SDK. The code is barely recognizable as
being from there but that's where I started and they deserve
credit for providing a great example.

Music related icons are licensed under the creative commons.

Theme related icons and images came from the example. I
haven't bothered changing them because I don't really care
about the branding / look of this player. It does what I want
it to do and that's good enough.

No warranties. If your house burns down it's not my fault.


License Stuff
=============

Let's pretend that I licensed this GPL... unless you happen to be
Roku. If you're Roku then let's pretend that I licensed this MIT.

Rational:
If you're Roku then my SDK license agreement with you says that I
can't force you to redistribute your modifications to this source.
Since I don't really care what you guys need to be able to do with
this code, you get it under MIT. Do whatever you gotta do.

If you're not Roku: I'd really like your contributions to help make
this player better. I won't force you to share (how could I?) but
I definitely want you to share any and all improvements.
