RssServer/Client

================================

A simple rss media server and a client designed for the
Roku set-top box.

The server code in this package is to be distributed under
the terms of the GPL. The client code is also GPL but with
a special exception for the Roku business entity (per their
SDK license agreement.)

Some third party code is also included in the tornado,
simplejson, and eyeD3 folders. Each of these are distributed
under their author's origin license (look in their source to
see what they are.)

BEGIN BIG WARNING

The way the server works essentially exposes all of the mp3's on
your computer to an outside user with intimate knowledge of this program.
Definitely don't run this unless your local network is somehow
isolated from the internet at large -- ie, you're behind a router.

In other words: If you're IP address isn't something like 192.*.*.*
or 10.*.*.* -- for the love of your data, PLEASE don't run the server.

END BIG WARNING


INSTALLATION
============

**All users**
Modify the following files to match your configuration:

server/rss_server.py
====================
Search for hostname and musicdir and set those
variables to match your configuration. For example, if your
server IP address is 192.168.2.100 and your music lives in
/home/user/Music --

hostname = "http://192.168.2.100:%d" % portno
musicdir = "/home/user/Music"

client/source/appMain.brs
=========================
Search for the word "buster" and replace that with the
ip address of your server. If your IP address is
192.168.2.100 then the line should read:

    pl=rss.GetSongListFromFeed("http://192.168.2.100:8001/feed")


**Dependencies: Linux Users**
Install python (you probably already have it)
Ubuntu users: sudo aptitude install python

**Dependencies: Windows Users**
Install python
Go to http://www.python.org/download and select
the Windows installer that suits your platform
(32 or 64 bit.) Run it, accept all the defaults,

*All Users*
Start the server by moving into the directory and
running rss_server.py. It's important that server be the
current working directory. In linux this means cd to that
directory and then type
python rss_server.py

In windows... not sure yet. Someone should tell me.

This is a work in progress. I welcome feedback from your
experiences. Let's make this readme file much better.
