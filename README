This media player is derived from the simplevideoplayer example
that comes with the Roku SDK. The code is barely recognizable as
being from there but that's where I started and they deserve
credit for providing a great example.

Music related icons are licensed under the creative commons.

Theme related icons and images came from the example. I
haven't bothered changing them because I don't really care
about the branding / look of this player. It does what I want
it to do and that's good enough.

No warranties. If your house burns down it's not my fault.
