RssServer/Client

================================

A simple rss media server and a client designed for the
Roku set-top box.

The server code in this package is to be distributed under
the terms of the GPL. The client code is also GPL but with
a special exception for the Roku business entity (per their
SDK license agreement.)

Some third party code is also included in the tornado,
simplejson, and eyeD3 folders. Each of these are distributed
under their author's origin license (look in their source to
see what they are.)

BEGIN BIG WARNING

The way the server works essentially exposes all of the mp3's on
your computer to an outside user with intimate knowledge of this program.
Definitely don't run this unless your local network is somehow
isolated from the internet at large -- ie, you're behind a router.

In other words: If your IP address isn't something like 192.*.*.*
or 10.*.*.* -- for the love of your data, PLEASE don't run the server.

END BIG WARNING


INSTALLATION
============

**All users**
Modify the following files to match your configuration:

server/rss_server.py
====================
Search for hostname and musicdir and set those
variables to match your configuration. For example, if your
server IP address is 192.168.2.100 and your music lives in
/home/user/Music --

hostname = "http://192.168.2.100:%d" % portno
musicdir = "/home/user/Music"

client/source/appMain.brs
=========================
Search for the word "buster" and replace that with the
ip address of your server. If your IP address is
192.168.2.100 then the line should read:

    pl=rss.GetSongListFromFeed("http://192.168.2.100:8001/feed")


**Dependencies: Linux Users**
Install python (you probably already have it)
Ubuntu users: sudo aptitude install python

**Dependencies: Windows Users**
Install python
Go to http://www.python.org/download and select
the Windows installer that suits your platform
(32 or 64 bit.) Run it, accept all the defaults,

**Start Server: All Users**
Start the server by moving into the directory and
running rss_server.py. It's important that server be the
current working directory. In linux this means cd to that
directory and then type
python rss_server.py

In windows... not sure yet. Someone should tell me.

**Testing: All Users**

Test the server by pointing your browser at it. If you're
on your sever right now go to:
http://localhost:8001 (assuming you didn't change the port number)

If you see a list of songs and collections you did everything right
and are ready to install the client on your Roku box. If you see
Something that looks like an empty RSS feed then you did everything
but configure your music directory in the server. Kill the server,
scroll up, make the edits under the heading rss_server.py and try again.
If you see nothing, dunno what happened. Maybe firewall badness? Email
me if you're stumped.

**Install CLient: All Users**

Here's some more legal hairy-ness. Based on the SDK agreement with
Roku, I'm not sure what I'm allowed to tell you here... so you'll
have to discover it for yourself.

Search the web for "roku SDK" and hit the first link (the roku
developers site.) Agree to everything, download the sdk, and in the
documentation directory you'll find a document called the developers
guide which starts out with instructions for putting your player into
development mode. Do that stuff. Write down the IP address of your
player.

Now, set the environment variable ROKU_DEV_TARGET to the IP address you
wrote down, go into the client directory, and type:
make install

If you're a windows user, you'll find some instructions in the Roku
Developers guide for how to upload apps to your player via the web interface.
You'll want to zip up everything in the client directory (except Makefile
and the .git subdirectory if you got this using git) and upload that to
your player. I've never done this so I can't elucidate further. Please give
me feedback on how this works.

**Finally: All Users**
Fire up the client. It should very quickly give you a listing of the mp3's
and the subdirectories in the music directory you configured. Navigate,
hit enter, and you're off.

If it doesn't, you may have forgotten to set the host name in either the
client code or the server code. Do the server test above. If that works,
try it again from another computer (if you can.) If that doesn't work then
you probably have a firewall problem. If you can get to your server from
another computer then you probably didn't set the host correctly when you
edited the source code to the client. Go back and try again.

Still having problems? Email me and I may be able to help.


Good luck!!

This is a work in progress. I welcome feedback from your
experiences. Let's make this readme file much better.
